There can be up to 9 <url> tags within each movie tag. The webpages specified in 
the url tags should hold detailed information about the movie/tv series/mvid. In 
most cases one url will be enough. The url tag can have the argument 
function="nameoffunction" e.g. 
<xml><url function="CustomFunction">theurl</url></xml> 
In this case other then GetDetails, "CustomFunction" will be executed after 
GetDetails has run.

When using the scraper the user will be asked in Kodi to select one of the movies 
from the list which was returned by this function. The one which gets selected 
will be processed from there on.

By default Kodi will try to intelligently re-order the list of returned entries 
by comparing titles with the search string. If the results you are returning are 
already in a properly sorted order set <results sorted="yes">.
